FreshmenMMO: This is senior capstone work from my final semester in Extreme Programming. 

The Timer Manager is used to manage all timers by working with our TimerTableDataGateway. The timer manager is what is used to schedule a command with a timestamp of when the timer is going to run out. Timers cannot be stopped so we leave the completion logic up to the area that scheduled the command.

The messages were an exisiting functionality in the game that we changed to have a quiet flag to let the server know if we want this to go to all players or if we want to silence the message being sent. We also added the idea of a revelantplayerID this was added to ensure that we knew exactly who each message was relevant too. This functionality was used to create easter egg quests in later iterations that the player cannot see in the quest log but can be completed.

Bed Shaker: This is another senior capstone work from my final semester in Interdisiplinary Developemnt.

We worked as a team of five in a agile environment with a real client to create a mobile application that is going to be used by people who are hard of hearing. During the development of this application we learned how to work with android services, fragments, shared prefrences, and the API of the shelly smart switch. The app can be used to connect with a Shelly Plus Plug US so that when the user recieves a text message on there phone from a certain sender with a certain keyword it will trigger the smart switch to enable a bed shaker to wake them up.
